Concept Guides
==============

Concept Guide provides an A-Z overview of certain features and use-cases, helps out with the general understanding of complex topics and serves as a reference point to the documentation under Back-office and Storefront. Unlike the how-to approach of the Back-office section of the documentation, Concept Guides are here to give you overall context and references to other how-to articles in the documentation.
