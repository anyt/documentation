OroActionBundle
===============

OroActionBundle enables the user interface actions definition and configuration using YAML configuration files.

On top of the common |Action Component| and OroPlatform in general, ActionBundle provides a way to bring more complex solutions in ORO based projects with reusable components of configuration.

Those components are:

* **Buttons** - a user interface component that helps deliver custom actions for user interaction;
* **Operations** - configured user interaction elements (buttons, links or even further: forms, pages) with customized execution logic;
* **Action Groups** - complex business logic sets of backend actions grouped together under the named configuration nodes.
