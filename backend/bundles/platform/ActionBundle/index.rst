OroActionBundle
===============

OroActionBundle enables the user interface actions definition and configuration using YAML configuration files.

On top of the common :ref:`Action Component <bundle-docs-platform-action-bundle-action-component>` and OroPlatform in general, ActionBundle provides a way to bring more complex solutions in ORO based projects with reusable components of configuration.
