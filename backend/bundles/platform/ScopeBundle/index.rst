OroScopeBundle
==============

OroScopeBundle introduces the Scope entity into the Oro applications. A scope is a set of application parameters that have different values in different requests.

OroScopeBundle enables developers to establish a relation between scopes and other application data, then calculate current scopes at runtime at any point of the application flow and obtain authorized data for the scope.

.. comment: For working example of using scopes in Oro application, please check out the VisibilityBundle and AccountBundle code.
