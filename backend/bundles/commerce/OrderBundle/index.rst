OroOrderBundle
==============

OroOrderBundle adds the Order entity to the OroCommerce application and enables OroCommerce users in the back-office and customer users in the storefront to create and manage orders. In addition, it adds the Previously Purchased Products functionality.

The Previously Purchased Products functionality adds the previously purchased products grid to the customer pages under Account > Previously Purchased in the storefront. By default, previously purchased products are disabled. To enable them, navigate to **System > Configuration > Orders > Purchase History > Enabled Purchase History** in the back-office.
