Payment Term Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin

Payment term is a set of conditions required for the sale to be completed, e.g. the period that is allowed to a buyer to pay off the amount due. Payment terms may also include cash in advance requirement, cash collection on delivery, a deferred payment period of 10/20/30 days, etc.

In OroCommerce, you can use payment terms configured per customer to help them use the payment conditions guaranteed by their contract with your company.

Configure :ref:`Payment Term Integration <sys--integrations--manage-integrations--payment-term>` to enable payment term as a payment method on the checkout.
