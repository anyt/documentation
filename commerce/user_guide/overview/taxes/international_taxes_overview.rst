International Taxes Overview
----------------------------

Countries all over the world apply different sales tax rates, rules, and regulations. The U.S. has a complicated tax system that includes different sales tax rates for each state, as well different tax rates for certain industries, such as communication and lodging. In addition, the seller needs to be on top of any rate changes, make sure they are maintaining exemption certificates, and are complying with their tax filings. The picture might be even more complex in EU/non-U.S. countries, where VAT is the primary consumption tax.

While each country has a single tax rate, the seller must track which country is collecting the tax, if the buyer or seller pays the tax, which transaction stage VAT is added, and of the multiple refund levels.

* U.S.-based product sellers usually pay sales tax monthly, quarterly or yearly, depending on the rules set by the tax jurisdiction.

* Companies have to apply for a sales tax permit, to legitimately pay taxes in the jurisdiction.

* Depending on the tax jurisdiction, your company may be bound with tax obligation in the shipment origin (physical location of your warehouse storing the product you are selling), or in the selling destination - either shipment or billing address provided in the customer order.
