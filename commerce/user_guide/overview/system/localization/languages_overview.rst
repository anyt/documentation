Language is a core component of system loaclization and content translation in Oro applications that performs the following functions:

* Groups translations for all the text system elements available to the user (labels, UI, etc). 
* Enables download (export) and upload (import) of the system elements identifiers and their translation to the target language. This enables you to customize translation and update it in the current instance only.
* Enables installation of the translation updates from the third party translation services.
