In OroCommerce, you can create multiple websites that target a particular audience, geography, or that segments the goods and services your company is selling.

Every website may have:

* A dedicated web catalog that defines the website content (products, categories, web pages, etc)
* A set of price lists that may be isolated from the other websites
* Unique configuration that may (but not necessarily should) override the default system configuration
