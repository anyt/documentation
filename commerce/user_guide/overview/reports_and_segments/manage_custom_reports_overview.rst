Custom reports is an important ingridient of any custom data analysis. You might wnat to track an effetiveness of specific sales and marketing campaigns, or analyse the product line demand over the time, during the holidays, after rebranding, and when your competitors launched similar product. 

In OroCommerce, you can generate customized, ad-hoc reports on any KPI, data, or business operation.

OroCommerce comes with a powerful and flexible reports engine that lets users create reports on any metric, giving them unparalleled insights into their business performance. To create a report, simply navigate to “Reports and Segments,” then select “Manage Custom Reports” (see Reports UI below). Through its innovative User Interface, the reports engine allows anyone in the organization (based on roles and permissions) to generate reports on entities already in the system, as well as any custom entities created by the user.

Once a user selects a base entity (such as “Account”), he can refine the report by selecting any accompanying data needed for the report, such as the account name, associated business units, and so on. In addition, the user can further refine the report by applying data filters, such as date of creation or owner phone number, to further filter to the desired report. Afterwards, he can generate the report and save it to his own reports dashboard.
