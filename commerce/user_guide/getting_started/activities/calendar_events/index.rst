Calendar Events
===============

In OroCRM and in OroCommerce Management Console, you can create and monitor planned activities, like a call with the customer, as calendar events. These planned activities may be linked to the related data in OroCRM and OroCommerce (e.g. a demo may be linked to the opportunity in OroCRM and to the request for quote in OroCommerce).

You can leverage the following actions for managing calendar events (see aggregated information :ref:`here <doc-activities-events-actions>`):

* :ref:`Create <doc-activities-events-actions-add-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`View <doc-activities-events-actions-view-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Edit <doc-activities-events-actions-edit-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Delete <doc-activities-events-actions-delete-detailed>` a calendar event.
* :ref:`Reschedule <doc-activities-events-actions-changetimeframe>` a calendar event.
* Manage a calendar events :ref:`context <doc-activities-events-actions-context-detailed>`.
* :ref:`Comment <doc-activities-events-actions-comment-detailed>` on the calendar event.
* :ref:`Respond <doc-activities-events-actions-respond-detailed>` to the invitation in the calendar event with the *Accept/Tentative/Decline* status.
* :ref:`launch the hangout call <doc-activities-events-actions-hangout>` from the calendar event (available only when the google integration is enabled).

You can use most of these actions in the following perspectives:

a) :ref:`Today's Calendar <doc-widgets-today-calendar>` widget

d) **Activity** section of the related items - records in OroCRM and OroCommerce that are related to the customer user activity and have been added as a calendar event context. The event may be related to the opportunity, quote, customer user, contact, account, lead, business customer, case, request for quote, and order.
