Shopping Lists
==============

In OroCommerce, :term:`shopping lists <Shopping List>` are much more than merely a list of items in a cart. For one, in OroCommerce registered customers can create and manage not just one, but multiple shopping lists. This is useful when customers have to work on many projects that need different products for various needs. Unregistered customers, in turn, can purchase goods without the need of going through the registration process, which simplifies their shopping experience and saves time.

In the storefront, shopping lists are located in the top right corner and can be easily spotted.

The shopping lists button displays the number of shopping lists that have been created.

Clicking on the |IcChevronDown| icon next to the button will open a drop-down with all available shopping lists, the number of items in each of them, and a button to create a new shopping list.
