Checklist 
^^^^^^^^^

Prior to creating a configurable product, ensure that you have performed the following steps:

1. Created :ref:`attributes <products--product-attributes--create>`.
   
   A configurable attribute is one of the product attributes that are used to distinguish :ref:`product variants <doc--products--actions--create>` of the same configurable product. There should be at least one configurable attribute specified for the configurable product in order to enable a customer to select product variants.

2. Created a :ref:`product family <product--product-families--create>`.
   
   As a configurable product and all of its variants share the same set of attributes, they should share the product family as well.

3. Created :ref:`product variants (simple products) <products--products--create-simple-product>`.
   
   A configurable product may group several simple products or configurable product variants whose information mostly overlaps except for several product attributes. It means that you have to create a simple product for each variant that you need to add to the configurable product.

   .. note:: Make sure the configurable product you are creating has the same product unit as its product variants.

   .. note::  Product variants for configurable products in the storefront are displayed only when either customer users are logged in or :ref:`guest shopping lists <sys--conf--commerce--guest>` are enabled in the system configuration.


Flow 
^^^^

To add a new configurable product and make it available in the master catalog (for internal product management) and for purchase in the storefront:

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** using the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product**.

3. From the **Type** list, select *Configurable* to enable product variants.
   
4. Select the :ref:`product family <products--product-families>` to define the product options and details that will be filled in the following steps.

   .. note:: Ensure that the product attributes that store product variant options are created and included in the product's product family.

5. Place the product under the necessary category in the master catalog by clicking on the category. Use the search to filter the list of categories.

6. Click **Continue**.

7. In the **General** section, provide the following information:

   .. csv-table::
      :header: "Field", "Description"
      :widths: 30, 60

      "**Owner**","Limits the list of users who can manage the product."
      "**SKU**","Enter the product SKU number. The field is mandatory."
      "**Name**","Enter the name of the product. The field is mandatory."
      "**Configurable Attributes**", "Define the configurable attributes that distinguish product variants by selecting the check boxes next to them.

      .. note:: A configurable product should contain at least one configurable attribute of select or boolean type.

      "**Status**", "Select the product status (e.g., *Enabled*/*Disabled*). When disabled, the product is not included in the catalog and is considered to be a draft. The field is mandatory."
      "**URL Slug**", "Enter a URL slug that is used to build a human-readable URL for the product page in the storefront. If left blank, the slug will be autogenerated."
      "**Is Featured**", "Select whether the product is featured. The field is mandatory."
      "**New Arrival**", "Select whether the product is a new arrival. When set to *Yes*, the product is highlighted in the storefront. The field is mandatory."
      "**Description**", "Enter product description. A description is detailed information about the product that shows on the product view."
      "**Short Description**", "Enter a short description to be displayed in the catalog listing. Use the WISIWIG editor to format the information."
      "**Brand**", "Choose :ref:`the product brand <user-guide--product-brands>`, if available. Click |IcBars| to select the brand from the full list."

   Also, specify the value of your configurable attributes and define any other custom attributes if required.

#. In the **Image** section, add a new image to the product by clicking **+Add Image** and uploading the necessary file. You can select whether the image will be shown as *main* (the image is used in the product details view), *listing* (the image is shown in the catalog listing), or *additional* (additional product pictures). All three categories can be selected at the same time. To remove an image, click |IcClose| next to it.

#. In the **SEO** section, specify the required attributes:

   .. csv-table::
     :header: "Field", "Description"
     :widths: 30, 60

     "**Meta Keywords**", "Enter meta keywords for the product. A meta keyword is a specific type of a meta tag that appears in the HTML code of a web page and helps search engines to understand what the topic of the page is."
     "**Meta Title**", "Enter a meta title for the product. A meta title is what is seen by search engine users and helps a search engine to index the page."
     "**Meta Description**", "Enter a meta description for the product. A meta description summarizes the page content. Search engines show a meta description in search results when the searched phrase is found in the description."

   And any other custom attributes if defined.

#. In the **Design** section, select the :ref:`page template <user-guide--page-templates>` from the list.
