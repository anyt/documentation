Activities
==========

Activities are actions that employees of a company perform on a daily basis, be it fulfilling job tasks, communicating with colleagues and customers, or participating in events. In Oro, you can manage all of these activities conveniently and link them together to get a 360-degree view of all communications.

In Oro application, capabilities for managing activities are quite wide. Mainly, they cover three logical directions: workflow management, communications, and adding useful remarks.

To each activity, you can add links to the related records, such as a link to an email with the discussion in which the activity emerged. These links are called **contexts**, and they make it much easier to take account of all the details connected with the activity.
