Content Widgets
===============

Content widgets are snippets of structured information that you can insert into any WYSIWYG field in your application. WYSIWYG fields are available throughout OroCommerce; for example, on edit pages of products, content blocks, and landing pages.

There are three content widget types:

* An Image Slider
* A Contact Us form
* A Copyright

Each of these widget types has a different set of options.

Please keep in mind that:

Add a Content Widget to WYSIWYG Fields
--------------------------------------

You can add content widgets to WYSIWYG fields in your OroCommerce application, like content blocks, landing pages, etc.

To add a content widget to a field, drag the content widget element from the editor's manager panel, and drop it to the required location of the content field.
