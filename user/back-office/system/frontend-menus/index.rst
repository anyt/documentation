Frontend Menus
==============

In this section, you will learn the menu types available for the OroCommerce storefront and how to edit and configure them.

Permissions Required to Customize Frontend Menus
------------------------------------------------

The ability to configure menus globally, per organization, and for personal use is controlled by the two capabilities: **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration**.

By default, only users with Admin role have these capabilities enabled and may customize menus on all configuration levels.

To enable a user to personalise menus for themselves and configure menus for each organization individually, include the **Manage Menus** capability into the user role.

To enable a user to configure menus globally, for all organizations, websites, and users whose configuration fall back to the global settings, both **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration** capabilities should be enabled for the user role.
