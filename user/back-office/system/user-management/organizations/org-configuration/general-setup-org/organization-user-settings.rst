User Settings
=============

In the **User Settings** section, you can enable user impersonation for a specific organization. User impersonation allows back-office users with the **Impersonate User** :ref:`role capability <admin-capabilities>` to access and operate the OroCommerce storefront as if they were logged in as a specific customer user.

.. note:: The organization-level configuration has higher priority and overrides the system settings.

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organization** in the main menu.

2. For the necessary organization, click the |IcMore| **More Options** menu at the end of the row, and then click the |IcConfig| **Configure** icon to start editing the configuration.

3. Select **System Configuration > General Setup > User Settings** in the menu to the left.
