Quick Order Form
================

Registered and unregistered customers can use a quick order form for fast purchases in the Oro storefront. By default, quick order form is enabled, while guest quick order form is disabled. You can enable the latter on three levels â€“ globally, :ref:`per organization <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--organization>` and :ref:`per website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--website>`.

.. note:: Please note that website settings override organization, organization settings override system settings.
