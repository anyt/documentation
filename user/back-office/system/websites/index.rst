Websites
========

You can create multiple :term:`websites <Website>` that target a particular audience, geography, a specific brand, and a segment of goods or services that your company is providing.

.. note:: The multiple websites management is only available in the Enterprise edition.

Every website may have:

* A dedicated web catalog that defines the website content (products, categories, web pages, etc)
* A set of price lists that may be isolated from the other websites
* Unique configuration that may (but not necessarily should) override the default system configuration
