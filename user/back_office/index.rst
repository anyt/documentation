Back-Office
===========

Back-office is a primary management tool in OroCommerce and OroCRM that allows managers to perform all essential activities related to their eCommerce business, such as updating product lines, managing customers and sales, setting up taxes, running marketing campaigns, managing web store content, reporting, administering user roles, and other.

OroCommerce back-office places a great emphasis on an intuitive UI to help organize data, streamline typical back-office workflows, and enable maximum transparency for managers. In line with this approach, the back-office documentation section mirrors the structure of the UI to enable quicker orientation in the content.

This section contains a number of detailed how-to topics to help you make the application approachable and efficiently configure it to the needs of your business.
