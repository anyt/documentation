Developer Documentation
=======================

Developer Documentation is intended for developers and contains information about OroPlatform architecture, guidance on customization and extension of the existing features in Oro applications. Browse the how-to articles to learn about configuration and setup necessary for development or future use of the application.

.. hint:: The documentation is split into several sections:

        * **Backend Developer Guide** aggregates the core concepts for configuring, deploying, and maintaining your Oro application including API references, bundles, code samples, and best practices.
        * **Frontend Developer Guide** provides the themes to prototype your application's storefront and back-office design.
        * **Community Guide** instructs on how to contribute to the Oro application development, documentation, and translations. It also explains the philosophy of Oro releases and helps users join Oro community and support teams.

Use the left-panel menu or the search bar on the top right to navigate the documentation and discover how to:

* Configure the proper development or production environment for Oro applications
* Install the application and upgrade it to a new version
* Create a new bundle or extend the existing one
* Deal with entities and data management in the Oro application
* Configure access levels and permissions
* Translate and localize the content of the Oro application, the format of date and time, numeric and percent values, monetary values as well as the format of names and addresses
* Create a third-party integration through the OroIntegrationBundle
* Create Twig email templates with certain pre-defined placeholders to define template metadata
* Run regular time-based background tasks through cronjobs (on UNIX-based operating systems) or the Windows task scheduler
* Use OroCommerce REST API and WSSE Authentication to integrate Oro functionality into third-party software systems
