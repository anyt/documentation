Export Tax Rates
----------------

.. start

You might need to export the necessary tax rate details, download it as a .csv file, and reuse it in the third-party systems.

Another scenario for using export is when you plan bulk data update that is easily automated in the spreadsheet software.

To export the |exported_information| in a .csv format:

1. In the main menu, navigate to |menu_export|.

2. Select the items to export using check boxes at the beginning of the corresponding rows. You can filter the list in the table header, if necessary.

2. Click **Export**.

   After the following notification, you will receive an email with the link to download the .csv file.

3. Open the email and click the **Download** link.

   The file is automatically downloaded.

.. stop

.. |exported_information| replace:: tax rates

.. |menu_export| replace:: **Taxes > Taxes**
