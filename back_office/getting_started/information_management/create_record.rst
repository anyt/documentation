Create a Record
===============

To create a new record of an entity or to update details of the existing record, use the dedicated **Create <Entity name>** and **Edit <Entity name>** pages.

1. On the **All <Entity name>** page (the page with the list of all entity records), click the **Create <Entity name>** button in the top right corner. For example, navigate to **Marketing > Email Campaigns > Create Email Campaign** in the main menu.

2. Fill in all the required information.

   Note that mandatory fields are identified with the red asterisk.

   Available fields are usually gathered into logical sections. Click the section name to scroll the page to the fields that belong to this section.
