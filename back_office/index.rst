Back-office
===========

Back-office is a primary management tool in OroCommerce that allows managers to perform all essential activities related to their eCommerce business, such as updating product lines, managing customers and sales, setting up taxes, running marketing campaigns, managing webstore content, reporting, administering user roles, and other.

OroCommerce back-office places a great emphasis on an intuitive UI to help organize data, streamline typical back-office workflows, and enable maximum transparency for managers. With this new UI improvement, the back-office got an even more user-friendly and modern look in addition to becoming more flexible for customization by upgrading its CSS tools and libraries.
