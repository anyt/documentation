OroTaxBundle
============

OroTaxBundle introduces tax-related features in the OroCommerce application.

The bundle enables back-office users to create taxes, configure tax types for products, customers, and jurisdictions, as well as setup tax application rules based on the tax types.

With the corresponding configuration of the bundle, customers can view applied taxes for orders and quotes.

The bundle also provides an interface that enables developers to implement integrations with additional third-party tax providers to the OroCommerce applications.
