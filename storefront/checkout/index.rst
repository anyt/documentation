Once the products for purchase and their quantity have been selected, both registered and guest customers have to go through a series of steps to submit the order.

In the Oro storefront, the checkout can be multi page or single page. Although the checkout steps themselves are the same, the way they are displayed is different. For the multi page checkout, each step is displayed on a new page. For the single page checkout, all steps fit one page.
