Overview
--------

Master catalog is a tree structure that organizes all the products of your store under corresponding categories. A category combines the products of the same type into groups and helps enforce the unified selling strategy by configuring a special set of product options, :ref:`visibility <products--product-visibility>`, and SEO settings that best fit the resulting product family.

Once the categories are in place, you can:

* Add a category description and visuals.
* Link a corresponding product or a set of products to the selected category.
* Configure the default product options.
* Set up an activity type and a date for its implementation.
* Manage the category visibility.
* Configure SEO options.

To view the master catalog, navigate to **Products > Master Catalog** in the main menu.
The page displays all the categories created under this catalog.
