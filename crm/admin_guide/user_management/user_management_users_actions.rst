.. image:: ../img/user_management/user_create_general.png
    
4. Click **Additional** and provide more information about the user. In case any visible custom fields are added to the **User** entity, they appear in this section. 
 
5. Click **Access Settings**. This section must be filled in before the **Groups and Roles** section as the content available in the latter section depends on what is selected in **Access Settings**. 
 
6. (Only for Enterprise Edition) In the **Organizations** subsection, select the check boxes in front of the organization(s) you want the user to have access to.  
   
   .. caution::
        Note that the user will not be able to log in to the system if no organization is selected for them. 


7. Click the **Organization Business Units** field and type the business unit name or select it from the list. On the list, you can see business units of the organizations selected in the **Organizations** subsection. Business users selected here determine which business units the data owned by the user will belong to. Therefore, for successful configuration it is essential to correctly specify business units in this section. For more information on how to select business units dependently on the company structure, see the :ref:`Access to Organizations and Business Units Examples <doc-user-management-users-access-examples>` section.
   
   .. note::
        - You can select one or more business units. Then the data owned by the user will be considered as belonging to all these business units and users that have access to these business units and corresponding permissions will be able to access it. 
         
        - In case the user's role includes division level permissions, the user will be able to access data of each business unit specified in these sections, as well as the data of the whole chain of business units subordinated to those selected in this section. 

.. image:: ../img/user_management/user_create_accesssettings.png 

8. Click **Groups and Roles**. In the **Groups** subsection, select check boxes in front of the groups you want the user to be part of. All groups available in the system are listed here. A group is a set of users for convenience consolidated by one or more parameters. Instead of specifying each user one by one, you can specify a user group in filters and notification rules. For more information about groups, see the :ref:`User Groups <user-management-groups>` guide.

9. In the **Roles** subsection, select check boxes in front of the roles you want the user to have. Roles are predefined sets of permissions. When you assign a role to a user, you can be sure that the user will have access only to the information within the system that is necessary for them to do their work. For more information about roles, see the :ref:`Access and Roles Management <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` guide.

   .. important:: At least one role must be selected.

   .. caution::
      If the role is not 'System-Wide' and a particular organization is specified for it, check that the same organization is selected for a user in the **Access Settings** sections. Otherwise, the role does not appear in the **Roles** section.

.. _doc-user-management-users-actions-create-ldap:

Create Users via LDAP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. important:: 
   This feature is available only for OroCRM Enterprise Edition.

If your company is utilizing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server to guarantee that users can access corporate applications using the same credentials, you can significantly save time and effort on creating user records. OroCRM EE supports LDAP and thus allows you to import existing user information including role identifiers from the LDAP server into OroCRM.  

To enable import of LDAP records, you first need to set up integration with LDAP. After the integration has been established, user profiles will be imported to OroCRM and users will be able to use their usual credentials to log into OroCRM.

Using LDAP integration does not prevent you from creating user records in OroCRM manually. Manually created user records will not be imported back to your LDAP server.

System administrators will be able to tell if a user has been added via the LDAP integration: for such users the **LDAP Distinguished Names** field of their view pages will not be empty and will contain the corresponding value.

.. image:: ../img/user_management/user_ldap_distinguished_name.png 

For how to configure the LDAP integration, please see the `LDAP integration <../integrations/ldap-integration>`__ guide.

.. _doc-user-management-users-actions-api:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the integration with a third-party software or other work requirements demand a user to have the API access to OroCRM, generate an API key for the user. This key will be used to grant a user access to API while protecting their password from being disclosed to the third party.

.. important::
	Please note that an API key must be generated within the organization the data of which it will be used to access. 


  Therefore, there can be a situation when a user record has been created under organization A, and the user has access to and require an API key for organization B. In this case, you cannot generate an operational API key for the user. However, the user who has the corresponding permissions can log into the desired organization and generate an API key for themselves on the **My User** page.   
  

  Within one organization there can be only one API key at a time.
