Overview
--------

A user is the lowest element of the administrative structure in your company. Usually they are individuals employed by your company (or granted access under other conditions) who do all the work. However, it could also be a group of people or a third party system with a specific set of credentials (login and password) that can be used to access OroCRM. To facilitate the management of business process in your company and ensure that users can perform their job effectively and in the same time the sensitive data of your company is well protected, it is essential to correctly configure user records and set up access settings. 

Any amount of users can be created within one OroCRM system.
