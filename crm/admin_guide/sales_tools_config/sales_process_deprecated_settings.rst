Sales Process (Deprecated) Settings
===================================

In **System>Configuration>CRM>Sales Pipeline>Sales Process (Deprecated)**, you can enable Sales Process by ticking :guilabel:`Enable Sales Process`. Note, however, that Sales Process is a deprecated feature and will be removed in later releases. The preferred way is direct manipulation of leads and opportunities, as described in the :ref:`Leads <user-guide-system-channel-entities-leads>` and :ref:`Opportunities <user-guide-system-channel-entities-opportunities>` sections of the guide. 

By default, **Sales Process** is disabled.
