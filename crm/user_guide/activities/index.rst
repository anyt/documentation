Activities
==========

Activities are actions that employees of a company perform on a daily basis, be it fulfilling job tasks, communicating with colleagues and customers, or participating in events. In Oro, you can manage all of these activities conveniently. For each activity, you can add links to the related records, such as a link to an email with the discussion in which the activity emerged. Such links are called **contexts**, and they make it much easier to take account of all the details connected with the activity.

Tasks
-----

Tasks are assignments that need to be completed by a user. Keeping track of tasks helps organize the work process and ensure that all the important work is done.

In your Oro application, you can create, assign tasks, organize them by priority, set their due date and manage them through their life cycles. 

.. note:: See a short demo on `how to create and manage tasks <https://www.orocrm.com/media-library/create-and-manage-tasks>`_, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.
