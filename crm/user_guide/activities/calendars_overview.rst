System and Organization Calendars
=================================

Efficient business today is hard to imagine without an easy-to-understand and up-to-date schedule. 
OroCRM provides each user with a calendar with tasks and events related to the specific user, to other users 
(subject to the :ref:`roles and permissions defined <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`), as well as to events 
defined for the whole organization or system.

Events in the System and Organization calendars can be viewed by all the users within the system/organization.
The ability to create, edit, and delete events depends on the user's :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` and :ref:`capabilities <admin-capabilities-org-calendar-events>`.

.. note:: See a short demo on `how to create and manage calendars <https://www.orocrm.com/media-library/create-and-manage-calendars#play=fVcOy3TmuQg>`_, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

Add an Event to a Calendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to add an event to a calendar:

1. Go to the :ref:`view page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the calendar.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Create Calendar Event` button.

3. The **Create Calendar Event** page will appear. The form has the following fields:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Title***","The event name. Must be defined."
  "**Description**","A free text field that you can use for additional information about the event"
  "**Start***","Time the event starts. Must be specified." 
  "**End***","Time the event ends. Must be specified."
  "**All day event**","Defines whether the event will take place for a whole day."
  "**Color**","Defines the color to be used to highlight the event when displayed in the calendar."
  
For example, we have created an event "Weekly report" event that will take place on July 16, 2015 from 3:35 to 4:35 PM.
The event will be highlighted as defined for the calendar by default.
