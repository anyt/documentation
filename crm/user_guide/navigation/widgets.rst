Dashboard Widgets
=================


Oro dashboard widgets are small applications that perform a single function and serve as blocks that you can use to build your dashboard with.

You can add widgets in any combination and move them around the page creating a dashboard that displays content in a way most convenient to you. Many widgets are customizable: you can set a custom name for them, apply filters to the data that widgets display and so on.
