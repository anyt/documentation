There are two ways two create an order in the storefront:

* From a shopping list
* From a quick order form

After you submit an order, it becomes available in the **Order History** menu which you can reach either via the Quick Access menu under **Orders**, or under **Account > Order History** in the menu on the left. Here, you can review ordered items, view order billing and shipping information and re-order products from previous orders.
