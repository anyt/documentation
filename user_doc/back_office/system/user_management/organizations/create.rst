   * **Status** --- The current status of the organization (active or inactive).
   * **Name** --- The name used to refer to the organization on the interface.
   * **Description** --- Short description of the organization record.

4. In the **Users** section, select the **Has Group** check box next to the required users to add them to the organization you are creating.
5. In the **Additional** section, specify whether the organization has global access level. Only one organization with global access can exist in the system. When the organization with global access already exists in the system, the **Global Access** field is disabled.
6. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the organization is available on the list of all organizations under **System > User Management > Organizations**, where you can filter them by name, edit organizations, and access configuration settings.
