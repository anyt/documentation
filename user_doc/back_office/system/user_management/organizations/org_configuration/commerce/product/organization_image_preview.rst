   In the Image Gallery Options section, enable or disable the required options.

4. **Enable Image Preview on Product Listing**:

   * When **Enable Image Preview on Product Listing** is enabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open a pop up image gallery, rather than the product page.

       :class: with-border

   * When **Enable Image Preview on Product Listing** is disabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open the product page.

       :class: with-border

    .. note:: When **Use System** checkbox is enabled, system settings are applied.

5. **Popup Gallery on Product View**

   * When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is enabled, image gallery in the storefront will take the following form:

     .. image::/img/system/user_management/org_configuration/products/ImageGalleryOrganizationEnabled.png
        :class: with-border

     By clicking on the image, the pop up gallery will be displayed in the middle of the screen:

     .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/user_management/org_configuration/products/ImageGalleryOrganizationEnabled2.png
        :class: with-border

   * When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is disabled, the image gallery will take the form of an inline view:

     .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/user_management/org_configuration/products/ImageGalleryOrganizationDisabled.png
        :class: with-border

     Flick through the pictures in the gallery by pressing < or > arrows without leaving the product page.

   .. note:: When **Use System** checkbox is enabled, system settings are applied.
