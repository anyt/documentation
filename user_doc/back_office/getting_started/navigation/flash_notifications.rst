Flash Notifications
===================

To inform a user about any event that has been executed or failed in the system, use a flash notification.

Success flash messages are displayed against a green background:

If something goes wrong, the flash message is displayed against a red background in order to attract your attention.

Other flash messages have a yellow background.

Sometimes, a flash message can contain links to other pages.

Flash messages appear on the top of the screen for several seconds and then disappear.
