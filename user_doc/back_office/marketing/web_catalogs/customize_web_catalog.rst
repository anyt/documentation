3. In the *Restriction section*, define the visibility of the web catalog.

   By default, the web catalog is displayed for any localization, on any website, and for any customer.

   To make OroCommerce apply a web catalog to the storefront only for the particular combination of these facts, create a restriction by selecting all or some of the following: target localization, website, and customer or customer group.

   :class: with-border

.. note:: Only one field must be chosen for customers at a time, either a customer group and a customer.

.. warning:: Never leave the restrictions for non-default variant empty. This may cause unexpected priority collision between the default and non-default variant.
